## Research Experience

`Sep 2018 - Aug 2019`
__Modeling the steady state neutron distribution of a nuclear reactor using two-group neutron diffusion equations__ - *Thesis*

- I worked on developing a program to calculate the neutron distribution of a nuclear reactor.
- As an extension, I am working on calculating fast spectrum multigroup constants independently.

`Oct 2017 - Jan 2018`
__Design of a magneto-inertial fusion reactor__ - *Project*

- I devised a generic design of a magneto-inertial fusion reactor.
- A simulation of the design was established on EIRENE.

`Jun 2018 - Aug 2018`
__Difference of information density in natural languages__ - *Project*

- In this independent project, I tried to numerically measure the differences in the information density in 3 closely related languages (English, German, Spanish).
- For calculation, a few short articles which had readily available translations in all 3 languages were chosen.

`Mar 2018 - Apr 2018`
__Measuring the atomic composition of soil samples using neutron activation analysis__ - *Training*

- During my industrial training in Atomic Energy Research Establishment, I worked with the research team in Reactor & Neutron Physics Division.
- The task was to measure the atomic composition of two soil samples using two standards (NIST Soil-7, SRM 1633b).


## Work Experience

`Oct 2019 - Present`
__Academic Member, Resource Person__ - *Bangladesh Math Olympiad*

- I set problems for the Bangladesh Math Olympiad.
- I work as a resource person in a subproject where my job is to train master trainers working in the primary education sector.

`Jul 2015 - Present`
__Editor, Co-founder__ - *Shoshikkha*

- I write science articles and set weekly quiz problems.
- Our organization was featured in the Daily Sun for our work in spreading scientific information in the native language.

`Nov 2012 - Jan 2014`
__Editor, Event Organizer__ - *Notre Dame Nature Study Club*
